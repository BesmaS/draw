# Draw++

## Overview

Draw++ is a graphical drawing application that allows users to create and manipulate various shapes using a simple scripting language. The application leverages SDL2 for rendering graphics and provides a Python-based IDE for writing and executing scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run Draw++, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
  - Tkinter
  - ttkbootstrap
- SDL2
- GCC 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage

To start using Draw++, open the Python-based IDE and load or create a new script. Use the provided commands to draw shapes and manipulate them on the canvas.
## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use Draw++:

### Example 1: create a Cursor
```python
# Create a cursor at position (10,20)
createCursor(cursor1,10,20);
```

### Example 2: set a color

```python
# Set color to the cursor
setColor(cursor1,#FF5733);
```

### Example 3: Move a Cursor

```python
# Move to a new position
move(cursor1,50);
```
### Example 3: Draw rectangles

```python
# Draw rectangles
drawRectangle(cursor1,21,12,2,3);
```

These examples demonstrate basic usage of Draw++ to create and manipulate shapes using the provided scripting commands.
