# Draw++

## Overview

Draw++ is a graphical drawing application that allows users to create and manipulate various shapes using a simple scripting language. The application leverages SDL2 for rendering graphics and provides a Python-based IDE for writing and executing scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run Draw++, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
  - Tkinter
  - ttkbootstrap
- SDL2
- GCC 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage

To start using Draw++, open the Python-based IDE and load or create a new script. Use the provided commands to draw shapes and manipulate them on the canvas.
## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use Draw++:

### Example 1: Drawing a Rectangle

```python
# Draw a rectangle at position (50, 50) with width 100 and height 200
draw_rectangle(50, 50, 100, 200)
```

### Example 2: Drawing a Circle

```python
# Draw a circle at position (150, 150) with radius 75
draw_circle(150, 150, 75)
```

### Example 3: Moving a Shape

```python
# Move the rectangle to a new position (200, 200)
move_shape('rectangle', 200, 200)
```

### Example 4: Changing Shape Color

```python
# Change the color of the circle to blue
change_color('circle', 'blue')
```

These examples demonstrate basic usage of Draw++ to create and manipulate shapes using the provided scripting commands.
